# OfficeRoom

OfficeRoom is a web-based application designed for office furniture and accessory management or e-commerce. The project is structured as a Node.js/Express application, with multiple HTML pages, client-side JavaScript, and a CSS stylesheet. It supports features such as product browsing, user authentication, cart and checkout processes, and customizable product views.

> **Note:** This project is still a work in progress and continues to improve as I learn and develop new skills.
>
> _You may also find files like `prac.js`—these are just for my basic JavaScript practice and experimentation as I continue learning._
